Why Beaver Cognition demonstrates that all cognitive theories fail. 

Cognitive theories have been criticised for failing to capture the reality of cognitive landscapes. 

By cognitive theories, I mean all theories that propose an internal, external or relational representation of cognition.  

Most criticisms have concentrated on a particular theory or version and subjected it to logical and philosophical argument or empirical evidence. 

I would like to take a different approach. 

I will offer the following example (of Beaver facts): 

(1) They do not possess deductive reasoning, propositional attitudes, abstract thinking or symbolic manipulation. 
(2) They do not have language. 
(3) Individual beavers, on sighting a predator, slap their tail, alerting another beaver up to 15 metres away, who then submerges. This happens in under 200 milliseconds. 
(4) Individual beavers identify leaks by sound. 
(5) They select the correct material to repair the leak. 
(6) These dams are built without any plans. 
(7) They do not possess textbooks or universities. 
(8) These dams can be orphaned - exist prior to a colony adoption - and, successive generations modify them. 
(9) Orphaned beavers can build dams without any input. 
(10) They can extend over many hundreds of metres. 
(11) They build false dams or training dams. 

How is this possible? 

Let’s take ‘internal cognition’ (IC). 

I construe this as putting forward the idea that cognition is: (A) representative; (B) can be modelled by computational methods; (C) internal; and (D) correspondence. 

If A and B or C and D fail, then IC fails as a whole. 

IC fails to explain 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. 

Therefore, IC fails. 

Let’s take ‘external cognition’ (EC). 

I construe this as putting forward the idea that cognition is: (E) external coupling = cognitive constitution; (F) environmental determinism; (G) agentive autonomy; and, (H) systemic closure. 

If A and B or C and D fail, then EC fails as a whole. 

EC fails to explain 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11. 

Therefore, EC fails. 

If IC and EC both fail, then ‘relational cognition’ (RC) also fails. 

So, what is left? 

The only thing that remains is beaver ‘cognition’ - whatever that means (whether instinct, behaviour, etc.). 

I offer an analogy with language: if we picture a river where the ‘current’ represents the underlying ‘syntactical and morphological structure,’ then the boat floating along on top represents the ‘grammar.’ In our case, the various cognitive theories are the boats, and beaver ‘cognition’ is the current. 

If all internal, external and relational cognitive theories fail, then the whole anthropomorphic edifice (from Descartes onwards) separating animals from humans fails. This has ethical (and legal) consequences for animal rights without appealing to ‘consciousness’ or ‘sentience’ - as is usually the case.
